# gear_classifier
Gear classification and segregation using CNN and arduino. Types of gears --> Spur gear, herringbone gear
Image Dataset of gears is generated using script "image.py", for three classes i.e. Spur gear, herringbone gear, and images with no gears or blank.
CNN model is generated based on the dataset.
CNN model is used in "script_with_detection_and_arduino_servo.py"
Servo  motor is controled throgh arduino using python to collect gears in separate box.
